# Cal1Cardistry
A Chrome extension which consolidates information about your Cal1Card (meal swipes remaining, debit dollars, flex dollars) into one place. 

## Status Update: 03/06/2020 
The extension's core functionality is up and running. I'm working on presenting the information in a more convenient manner (perhaps with a New Tab override) as well as improving reliability on weak internet connections by having the extension auto refresh itself. 


## Try It Yourself! 
If you want to try this extension for yourself: 
* Download the entire repository. 
* Navigate to chrome://extensions in developer mode. 
* Click 'Load unpacked' and select the folder containing the repository. 

Make sure that you are signed into your Cal1Card account (with CalNet Authentication already authorized), then refresh and click the extension icon in the top bar.
